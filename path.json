It is composed of semiconductor material usually with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit. A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals controls the current through another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal. Today, some transistors are packaged individually, but many more are found embedded in integrated circuits.","creator":"215972819492798464","createdon":"2020-06-07T19:01:16Z","commenter":"","colorer":"333297586955878401","imager":"","treesize":31},"1000":{"name":"Wire Cutter","parents":[62,288],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718644692438220850/851139080430682125/51CfdMbnMaL._AC_SL1000_.jpg","color":"10933300","comment":"Removes wire.

In a pure form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides).","creator":"295686792664055808","createdon":"2020-06-28T05:13:43Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":22},"11":{"name":"Sand","parents":[5,5],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718644692438220850/1179304311847657502/300px-Libya_4608_Idehan_Ubari_Dunes_Luca_Galuzzi_2007.png?ex=65794bba\u0026is=6566d6ba\u0026hm=72099b052880b481c99d7eb73a4adf174f40ed4dfac73ef01ae2178681bb62f9\u0026","color":"15456160","comment":"\" I don't like sand.

With a standard atomic weight of 1.008, hydrogen is the lightest element in the periodic table. Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass. Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed protium (name rarely used, symbol 1H), has one proton and no neutrons.\n\nThe universal emergence of atomic hydrogen first occurred during the recombination epoch (Big Bang). At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most nonmetallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water or organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions because most acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., anion) when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex. As the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.","creator":"215972819492798464","createdon":"2020-06-07T21:49:13Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":5},"157":{"name":"Oxygen","parents":[1,90],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718644692438220850/1179300672374587412/Z.png?ex=65794856\u0026is=6566d356\u0026hm=9f5f47bb7f04663abf34659f889446c4bfc4f0a9ae905a0bd025697827364fe5\u0026","color":"8047530","comment":"Oxygen is the chemical element with the symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and an oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds. After hydrogen and helium, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe by mass. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O\n2. Diatomic oxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% of the Earth's atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth's crust in the form of oxides.\n\nDioxygen provides the energy released in combustion and aerobic cellular respiration, and many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen is continuously replenished in Earth's atmosphere by photosynthesis, which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water and carbon dioxide. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms. Another form (allotrope) of oxygen, ozone (O\n3), strongly absorbs ultraviolet UVB radiation and the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a byproduct of smog and thus a pollutant.","creator":"215972819492798464","createdon":"2020-06-07T21:49:16Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":12},"157307":{"name":"Resistor","parents":[60,716],"image":"","color":"5956142","comment":"None","creator":"437322226099027969","createdon":"2021-10-15T16:04:16Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":33},"15736":{"name":"Ammonia","parents":[156,156,156,2298],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/705092939029938186/757429058572124240/150px-Ammonia-2D.png","color":"9230165","comment":"Ammonia is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen with the formula NH3.","creator":"682382451716390939","createdon":"2020-09-21T00:32:04Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":14},"15740":{"name":"Phosphoric Acid","parents":[156,156,156,157,157,157,157,3100],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/705092939029938186/757445642892214412/150px-Phosphoric-acid-2D-dimensions.png","color":"6803574","comment":"Phosphoric acid, also known as orthophosphoric acid or phosphoric(V) acid, is a weak acid with the chemical formula H3PO4.","creator":"682382451716390939","createdon":"2020-09-21T00:52:42Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":20},"158":{"name":"Moss","parents":[4,80,80,80,80,80],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/705084184443486291/1155023688056438854/Tumblr_l_9058379686489.jpg","color":"7134248","comment":"A small flowerless green plant which lacks true roots, growing in low carpets or rounded cushions in damp habitats and reproducing by means of spores released from stalked capsules.","creator":"536715150149943296","createdon":"2020-06-07T21:50:50Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":8},"1581":{"name":"14","parents":[1412,1431],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/705084184443486291/1132694350506242099/Screenshot_2023-07-20-17-32-12-18_f9ee0578fe1cc94de7482bd41accb329.jpg","color":"1315860","comment":"13 but +1\n15 but -1","creator":"673616985526894595","createdon":"2020-07-13T12:08:10Z","commenter":"748456863477006336","colorer":"189338046410391552","imager":"","treesize":11},"1583":{"name":"E","parents":[1955,1955],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718644692438220850/1081399037246312488/2Q.png","color":"15658734","comment":"**E.**\n\nThe second best letter, and letter that YouTube premiere chat uses a lot.\n\n*In toki pona, it is a word that is used before the direct object in a sentence.*","creator":"673616985526894595","createdon":"2020-07-13T12:09:45Z","commenter":"925176066820153354","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":35},"1584":{"name":"N","parents":[1281,8442],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/751121133981401310/789966401359577118/1200px-LetterN.png","color":"16777215","comment":"toki pona: (indicates thinking, pondering, recognition, agreement, or humming)","creator":"673616985526894595","createdon":"2020-07-13T12:09:51Z","commenter":"255399735962107905","colorer":"189338046410391552","imager":"","treesize":47},"1585":{"name":"W","parents":[1951,17397],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/705084184443486291/1045418573843157043/Guyanas.svg.png","color":"16777215","comment":"W is the 23rd letter of the latin alphabet.

- Mist is a phenomenon caused by small droplets of water suspended in the cold air, usually by condensation. Physically, it is an example of a dispersion. It is most commonly seen where water vapor in warm, moist air meets sudden cooling, such as in exhaled air in the winter, or when throwing water onto the hot stove of a sauna. It can be created artificially with aerosol canisters if the humidity and temperature conditions are right. It can also occur as part of natural weather, when humid air cools rapidly, notably when the air comes into contact with surfaces that are much cooler than the air (e.g. mountains).","creator":"668389663299469313","createdon":"2020-07-13T13:53:00Z","commenter":"317689810691293195","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":3},"169":{"name":"Logic","parents":[167,1210],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/751121166051049512/898015726697340938/unknown.png","color":"16777215","comment":"Logic is an interdisciplinary field which studies truth and reasoning.","creator":"215972819492798464","createdon":"2020-06-07T22:10:41Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":21},"17":{"name":"Energy","parents":[462,462,462],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/847293815311826954/1179246868954349629/IMG_4086-1024x768-3000x1300.jpg?ex=6579163a\u0026is=6566a13a\u0026hm=a11a3067a54dd8a9933d31958407ca318c6b70437a1e1f71e5a3bfc46df6c0f3\u0026","color":"16776960","comment":"Otters use this to do stuff!","creator":"173752175175008256","createdon":"2020-06-07T18:13:28Z","commenter":"517921690307526656","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":5},"17040":{"name":"Reduction","parents":[979,6201],"image":"","color":"8774194","comment":"None","creator":"422039592661942272","createdon":"2020-09-25T02:40:44Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":34},"17059":{"name":"Formaldehyde","parents":[156,156,157,282],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/705084184443486291/1163953136306757642/image.png?ex=654172d4\u0026is=652efdd4\u0026hm=fd3250c0c3bc93472ec8dfd565136e7f4dcfff613c5fbc0b2de7fc2e6d49198e\u0026","color":"7523932","comment":"None","creator":"511108607043960843","createdon":"2020-09-25T09:22:47Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":23},"171":{"name":"Ness","parents":[165,165],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/751121166051049512/898016990604705902/unknown.png","color":"15884901","comment":"Ness (Japanese: ネス, Hepburn: Nesu) is a fictional character in the Mother role-playing video games published by Nintendo, created by Japanese video game designer Shigesato Itoi.","creator":"215972819492798464","createdon":"2020-06-07T22:11:51Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":5},"17156":{"name":"Xbox 360","parents":[1,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4],"image":"","color":"7198023","comment":"None","creator":"525330319747055616","createdon":"2020-09-25T13:12:47Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":3},"1718":{"name":"Doctor","parents":[56,790],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/749335826223333516/999557765196423258/unknown.png","color":"7526453","comment":"None","creator":"673616985526894595","createdon":"2020-07-13T15:30:23Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":16},"172":{"name":"Ash","parents":[1,1,2,2,3],"image":"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/images/full/ash_211797523.jpg","color":"9407613","comment":"The powdery residue left after the burning of a substance.","creator":"101070932608561152","createdon":"2020-06-07T22:12:03Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":4},"172221":{"name":"Cheese Stone","parents":[343,812],"image":"","color":"14611983","comment":"A stone make out of cheese, go figures.

Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female is referred to as a ewe (/juː/), an intact male as a ram, occasionally a tup, a castrated male as a wether, and a young sheep as a

You will be mining resources, researching technologies, building infrastructure, automating production and fighting enemies.\n\nIn the beginning you will find yourself chopping trees, mining ores and crafting mechanical arms and transport belts by hand, but in short time you can become an industrial powerhouse, with huge solar fields, oil refining and cracking, manufacture and deployment of construction and logistic robots, all for your resource needs. However this heavy exploitation of the planet's resources does not sit nicely with the locals, so you will have to be prepared to defend yourself and your machine empire.\n\nJoin forces with other players in cooperative Multiplayer, create huge factories, collaborate and delegate tasks between you and your friends.\n\nAdd mods to increase your enjoyment, from small tweak and helper mods to complete game overhauls, Factorio's ground-up Modding support has allowed content creators from around the world to design interesting and innovative features. While the core gameplay is in the form of the freeplay scenario, there are a range of interesting challenges in the form of the Scenario pack, available as free DLC. If you don't find any maps or scenarios you enjoy, you can create your own with the in-game Map Editor, place down entities, enemies, and terrain in any way you like, and even add your own custom script to make for interesting gameplay.","creator":"666999744572293170","createdon":"2020-07-30T02:59:28Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":23},"2274":{"name":"2D","parents":[837,1417],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/751121166051049512/754005714128601118/300px-Cartesian-coordinate-system.png","color":"4317503","comment":"Two dimensions; the only things that can exist in two dimensions are planes and lines.

is a chemical element with the symbol B and atomic number 5. Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in the Solar System and in the Earth's crust. It constitutes about 0.001 percent by weight of Earth's crust. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite. The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals.\n\nElemental boron is a metalloid that is found in small amounts in meteoroids but chemically uncombined boron is not otherwise found naturally on Earth. Industrially, very pure boron is produced with difficulty because of refractory contamination by carbon or other elements. Several allotropes of boron exist: amorphous boron is a brown powder; crystalline boron is silvery to black, extremely hard (about 9.5 on the Mohs scale), and a poor electrical conductor at room temperature. The primary use of elemental boron is as boron filaments with applications similar to carbon fibers in some high-strength materials.","creator":"571762772409581585","createdon":"2020-07-30T13:24:25Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":38},"2298":{"name":"Nitrogen","parents":[1,1,21],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718644692438220850/1179300745837813760/Z.png?ex=65794868\u0026is=6566d368\u0026hm=0b2c22dd2be188dcd68efe4e6a3489c63f48900b67570536b4bec5c8b326ae83\u0026","color":"11983954","comment":"Nitrogen is the chemical element with the symbol N and atomic number 7. It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772. Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish had independently done so at about the same time, Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first. The name nitrogène was suggested by French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates. Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the Ancient Greek: ἀζωτικός \"no life\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; this name is used instead in many languages, such as French, Italian, Russian, Romanian, Portuguese and Turkish, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.\n\nNitrogen is the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table, often called the pnictogens. It is a common element in the universe, estimated at about seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dinitrogen, a colourless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula N2. Dinitrogen forms about 78% of Earth's atmosphere, making it the most abundant uncombined element. Nitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in amino acids (and thus proteins), in the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate. The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. The nitrogen cycle describes movement of the element from the air, into the biosphere and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere.","creator":"571762772409581585","createdon":"2020-07-30T13:24:29Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":11},"229974":{"name":"Damp N-Quartz Lump [NDs]","parents":[228281,229360],"image":"","color":"9101886","comment":"","creator":"663139761128603651","createdon":"2022-01-25T16:40:47Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":1783},"229975":{"name":"N-Flint Chunk [NDs]","parents":[228281,229362],"image":"","color":"9101886","comment":"","creator":"663139761128603651","createdon":"2022-01-25T16:40:49Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":1783},"229976":{"name":"Simple N-Fire Set [NDs]","parents":[229083,229975],"image":"","color":"9101886","comment":"","creator":"663139761128603651","createdon":"2022-01-25T16:44:14Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":1784},"229977":{"name":"N-Flint Stiffened N-Ucalip Mesh [NDs]","parents":[229267,229975,229975],"image":"","color":"9101886","comment":"","creator":"663139761128603651","createdon":"2022-01-25T16:44:16Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":1784},"229978":{"name":"Dried N-Quartz Lump [NDs]","parents":[228282,229974],"image":"","color":"9101886","comment":"","creator":"663139761128603651","createdon":"2022-01-25T16:44:17Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":1784},"229986":{"name":"Dried N-Quartz Fragments [NDs]","parents":[229097,229978],"image":"","color":"9101886","comment":"","creator":"663139761128603651","createdon":"2022-01-25T16:48:17Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":1788},"229987":{"name":"N-Fire Campfire [NDs]","parents":[228282,229269,229976],"image":"","color":"9101886","comment":"","creator":"663139761128603651","createdon":"2022-01-25T16:49:07Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":1787},"229988":{"name":"Tiny N-Aluminium Fragment [NDs]","parents":[229261,229977],"image":"","color":"9101886","comment":"","creator":"663139761128603651","createdon":"2022-01-25T16:49:09Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":1785},"229991":{"name":"N-Charcoal [NDs]","parents":[229348,229987],"image":"","color":"9101886","comment":"","creator":"663139761128603651","createdon":"2022-01-25T16:49:53Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":1798},"229992":{"name":"Powdered N-Aluminium [NDs]","parents":[229097,229988],"image":"","color":"9101886","comment":"","creator":"663139761128603651","createdon":"2022-01-25T16:49:55Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":1789},"229993":{"name":"N-Quartz Crystal Solution [NDs]","parents":[229088,229986],"image":"","color":"9101886","comment":"","creator":"663139761128603651","createdon":"2022-01-25T16:49:55Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":1789},"229999":{"name":"N-Thermite Powder [NDs]","parents":[229359,229992],"image":"","color":"9101886","comment":"","creator":"663139761128603651","createdon":"2022-01-25T16:59:20Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":1794},"23":{"name":"Ice","parents":[4,20],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718644692438220850/1179304804506402856/large-ice-chunks-seen-kenosha-wisconsin.png?ex=65794c2f\u0026is=6566d72f\u0026hm=40d1518c9404b1a1b8bc2c60fe6e840aa3ddfc1bd2d03ebff3eb9602ad247429\u0026","color":"12779513","comment":"Noun: Solid water\nVerb: To add icing","creator":"215972819492798464","createdon":"2020-06-07T18:15:33Z","commenter":"472694377530261514","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":6},"2300":{"name":"Lithium","parents":[156,162,954],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718644692438220850/1179300343708930129/150px-Limetal.png?ex=65794808\u0026is=6566d308\u0026hm=6685844dd6a2ba0797983493d293e09f32a3d244040e30178f519f9f75177378\u0026","color":"5953628","comment":"Lithium (from Greek: λίθος, romanized: lithos, lit. 'stone') is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the lightest metal and the lightest solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in mineral oil. When cut, it exhibits a metallic luster, but moist air corrodes it quickly to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It never occurs freely in nature, but only in (usually ionic) compounds, such as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\n\nThe nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability, since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common. For related reasons, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully man-made nuclear reaction, and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.\n\nLithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium batteries, and lithium-ion batteries. These uses consume more than three-quarters of lithium production.","creator":"571762772409581585","createdon":"2020-07-30T13:24:41Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":17},"230000":{"name":"N-Charcoal Campfire

is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.","creator":"248259674955055105","createdon":"2020-06-07T23:38:19Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":3},"251":{"name":"Sky","parents":[2,250],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718644692438220850/1173269082817167400/image0.jpg?ex=656356fb\u0026is=6550e1fb\u0026hm=26c6f7d8a953d14e046a255757978663c1c2f76d78860a523b9758923791a6d1\u0026","color":"8900331","comment":"The panorama obtained from observing the universe from the Earth and other celestial bodies' surface.","creator":"248259674955055105","createdon":"2020-06-07T23:38:43Z","commenter":"451774505262514198","colorer":"278931380191100929","imager":"","treesize":5},"2511":{"name":"Lava Pond","parents":[6,6,6,6,6],"image":"","color":"9884714","comment":"None","creator":"192300818953797632","createdon":"2020-08-19T16:32:16Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":4},"2543":{"name":"Mold","parents":[158,2253],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718644692438220850/1162148647891390575/Z.png?ex=653ae245\u0026is=65286d45\u0026hm=d868bb6f0a6a1076402f3e201670b0003b41fe03185e4c0f5021b4532d1190ba\u0026","color":"11450533","comment":"None","creator":"668389663299469313","createdon":"2020-08-19T17:08:47Z","commenter":"","colorer":"583581559701897220","imager":"","treesize":21},"255":{"name":"Flood","parents":[2,4,4],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/705092939029938186/1154712694725804052/Jpeg.png","color":"2155436","comment":"When the waves go too high","creator":"248259674955055105","createdon":"2020-06-07T23:42:24Z","commenter":"862046044862021682","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":3},"256":{"name":"Universe","parents":[13,7196],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/847293815311826954/1179247624210100234/image0.jpg?ex=657916ee\u0026is=6566a1ee\u0026hm=963ee8b947f33cabb7a340ba77eb4cdc185215acdd652594da30495c7d6fdd19\u0026","color":"6876963","comment":"Universe is all of space and time and their contents, including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy.

(from Latin: carbo \"coal\") is a chemical element with the symbol C and atomic number 6. It is nonmetallic and tetravalent—making four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. It belongs to group 14 of the periodic table. Carbon makes up only about 0.025 percent of Earth's crust. Three isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is a radionuclide, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.\n\nCarbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon's abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.","creator":"215972819492798464","createdon":"2020-06-08T01:24:27Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":19},"2839":{"name":"Slime","parents":[110,2133],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/749335826223333516/933326281909604392/latest.png","color":"2682669","comment":"None","creator":"447340800322306049","createdon":"2020-08-20T12:08:50Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":17},"286":{"name":"0","parents":[1414,1431],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/751121166051049512/944335933610786857/0.png","color":"0","comment":"0 is a number, and the numerical digit used to represent that number in numerals.

is one of the four fundamental states of HELL (the others being molten sulphur, gas, and plasma). The molecules in a solid are closely packed together and contain the least amount of suffering. A solid is characterized by structural rigidity and resistance to torture applied to the surface. Unlike a liquid, a solid object does not flow to take on the shape of its container, nor does it lustfully expand to fill the entire available volume like a gas. The atoms in a solid are bound on every level, including spiritual to each other, either in a regular geometric lattice (crystalline solids, which include metals and ordinary ice), or irregularly (an amorphous solid such as common window glass). Solids cannot be compressed with little pressure whereas gases can be compressed with little pressure because the molecules in a gas are loosely packed into the depths of hell.","creator":"248259674955055105","createdon":"2020-06-09T15:20:57Z","commenter":"574577108660256769","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":6},"6676":{"name":"Aluminium","parents":[21,1942,3276],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718644692438220850/1179301557804740649/Aluminum-vs-Aluminium-Eagle-Mouldings.png?ex=65794929\u0026is=6566d429\u0026hm=294cdfb4d39ea28c545697815cae028d93890389fd4e5096530c6d4e57e6e260\u0026","color":"5760819","comment":"Aluminium (aluminum in American and Canadian English) is a chemical element with the symbol Al and atomic number 13. Aluminium has a density lower than those of other common metals, at approximately one third that of steel. It has a great affinity towards oxygen, and forms a protective layer of oxide on the surface when exposed to air. Aluminium visually resembles silver, both in its color and in its great ability to reflect light. It is soft, non-magnetic and ductile. It has one stable isotope, 27Al; this isotope is very common, making aluminium the twelfth most common element in the Universe. The radioactivity of 26Al is used in radiodating.\n\nChemically, aluminium is a weak metal in the boron group; as it is common for the group, aluminium forms compounds primarily in the +3 oxidation state. The aluminium cation Al3+ is small and highly charged; as such, it is polarizing, and bonds aluminium forms tend towards covalency. The strong affinity towards oxygen leads to aluminium's common association with oxygen in nature in the form of oxides; for this reason, aluminium is found on Earth primarily in rocks in the crust, where it is the third most abundant element after oxygen and silicon, rather than in the mantle, and virtually never as the free metal.","creator":"422039592661942272","createdon":"2020-08-31T18:37:33Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":29},"668":{"name":"Red","parents":[161,186],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718644692438220850/1179216534963490896/220px-Taylor_Swift_-_Red_28Single29.png?ex=6578f9fa\u0026is=656684fa\u0026hm=a70a3b72af83d2b6362c1c88d2c50ed9c67ff4345ff764d52a9d7454d873ef1f\u0026","color":"16711680","comment":"The color of blood, the color of love, the color of beef, and the color of roses.\n\n\nAnd I guess Crimson Trees.","creator":"248259674955055105","createdon":"2020-06-09T15:22:22Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":22},"669":{"name":"Blue","parents":[161,251],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718644692438220850/1173867400312131614/270px-Noctilucent-clouds-msu-6817.png?ex=65658435\u0026is=65530f35\u0026hm=9e176ac7fb74bf88bdb9e9b46da791c7a5d0b9d2e3747f7b0df6fdd124412ac7\u0026","color":"255","comment":"One of the three primary colors of light.

The forge is used by the smith to heat a piece of metal to a temperature where it becomes easier to shape by forging, or to the point where work hardening no longer occurs. The metal (known as the \"workpiece\") is transported to and from the forge using tongs, which are also used to hold the workpiece on the smithy's anvil while the smith works it with a hammer. Sometimes, such as when hardening steel or cooling the work so that it may be handled with bare hands, the workpiece is transported to the slack tub, which rapidly cools the workpiece in a large body of water. However, depending on the metal type, it may require an oil quench or a salt brine instead; many metals require more than plain water hardening. The slack tub also provides water to control the fire in the forge.","creator":"215972819492798464","createdon":"2020-06-07T18:37:46Z","commenter":"","colorer":"451774505262514198","imager":"","treesize":21},"716":{"name":"Slow","parents":[718,3607],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718644692438220850/1173881504942800896/270px-MC_Drei-Finger-Faultier.png?ex=65659158\u0026is=65531c58\u0026hm=f085b71045dd0742010bfb2795b6b6e56de5575c96ac666dcfffa2e4d8d06a15\u0026","color":"6150718","comment":"Sudah biasa\nDiriku ditinggalkan\nDiacuhkan dan dicampakan\nOleh orang yang kucinta\nMenyakitkan\nTapi tak kurasakan\nKupasrahkan semua pada Tuhan\nYang telah mengatur semua\nJalanku dan juga jodohku\nDimanapun kapanpun itu\n\nKarna ku selow\nSungguh selow\nSangat selow\nTetap selow\nSantai...

Motion is mathematically described in terms of displacement, distance, velocity, acceleration, speed, and time. The motion of a body is observed by attaching a frame of reference to an observer and measuring the change in position of the body relative to that frame with change in time. The branch of physics describing the motion of objects without reference to its cause is kinematics; the branch studying forces and their effect on motion is dynamics.","creator":"269242185214328832","createdon":"2020-06-07T18:38:12Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":15},"741":{"name":"Thermal

It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas, the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements. Helium is the second lightest and second most abundant element in the observable universe (hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant). It is present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, which is more than 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this in both the Sun and in Jupiter. This is due to the very high nuclear binding energy (per nucleon) of helium-4, with respect to the next three elements after helium. This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. Most helium in the universe is helium-4, the vast majority of which was formed during the Big Bang. Large amounts of new helium are being created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars.","creator":"248259674955055105","createdon":"2020-06-16T12:43:06Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":14},"95460":{"name":"\u003c:eggtf:861270810151616545\u003e","parents":[1,1,2,3,3,4,4,4,64975],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/751121153594097835/1045417845917483008/unknown.png","color":"6808636","comment":":eggTF:","creator":"808010528857260073","createdon":"2021-07-10T21:00:06Z","commenter":"906206309777543198","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":6},"957":{"name":"Nope","parents":[655,3607],"image":"https://www.geekyhobbies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Exploding-Kittens-Nope.jpg","color":"16711680","comment":"Nope","creator":"437338265746669569","createdon":"2020-06-16T17:44:57Z","commenter":"525330319747055616","colorer":"432627802022346772","imager":"","treesize":9},"96":{"name":"Silicon","parents":[11,21],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718644692438220850/1179301706706731028/Silicon_5c.png?ex=6579494d\u0026is=6566d44d\u0026hm=6277f000924afd4154df2fe4178aa79d3a6c6b943b71bee5b56f86c3884eb55c\u0026","color":"11119017","comment":"Silicon is a chemical element with the symbol Si and atomic number 14. It is a hard, brittle crystalline solid with a blue-grey metallic lustre, and is a tetravalent metalloid and semiconductor. It is a member of group 14 in the periodic table: carbon is above it; and germanium, tin, and lead are below it. It is relatively unreactive. Because of its high chemical affinity for oxygen, it was not until 1823 that Jöns Jakob Berzelius was first able to prepare it and characterize it in pure form. Its oxides form a family of anions known as silicates. Its melting and boiling points of 1414 °C and 3265 °C respectively are the second-highest among all the metalloids and nonmetals, being only surpassed by boron. Silicon is the eighth most common element in the universe by mass, but very rarely occurs as the pure element in the Earth's crust. It is most widely distributed in space in cosmic dusts, planetoids, and planets as various forms of silicon dioxide (silica) or silicates. More than 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of silicate minerals, making silicon the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust (about 28% by mass), after oxygen.","creator":"215972819492798464","createdon":"2020-06-07T18:56:28Z","commenter":"","colorer":"451774505262514198","imager":"","treesize":11},"96496":{"name":"Uno","parents":[6153,14744],"image":"","color":"8577599","comment":"None","creator":"186541708014649344","createdon":"2021-07-12T20:09:02Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":8},"976":{"name":"Ore","parents":[2,34],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718644692438220850/1174889988102570014/224px-Roasted_Cripple_Creek_gold_ore.png?ex=65693c91\u0026is=6556c791\u0026hm=12ce077a7080c30a1685252e07e70d4b1acb0d5fabf1c6fe714f2d0a1b7f882e\u0026","color":"13350458","comment":"None","creator":"587414623066783744","createdon":"2020-06-18T02:55:41Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":12},"979":{"name":"Electron","parents":[21,60],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718644692438220850/1174889674381197322/1024px-Atomic-orbital-clouds_spd_m0.png?ex=65693c46\u0026is=6556c746\u0026hm=8af6abfbdd8bcd490be68aaf806ecb26da209944437d735c7a497ea004222db1\u0026","color":"7729949","comment":"None","creator":"248259674955055105","createdon":"2020-06-18T06:01:07Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":25},"982":{"name":"Juice","parents":[409,664],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/751121133981401310/789940631027712070/1200px-Orange_juice_1.png","color":"3794346","comment":"None","creator":"248259674955055105","createdon":"2020-06-19T00:39:07Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":29},"985":{"name":"Microchip","parents":[702,101631],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718644692438220850/1174890283067002890/photo-1555543451-eeaff357e0f3.png?ex=65693cd7\u0026is=6556c7d7\u0026hm=3d29438c063d88ba0904b3a56060d3f6feaad8d969a232ae120e4ffa5e1495cf\u0026","color":"9887288","comment":"None","creator":"587414623066783744","createdon":"2020-06-19T01:04:54Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":42},"99":{"name":"Diode","parents":[5682,13652],"image":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718644729298026537/1013817334605029419/unknown.png","color":"2434856","comment":"A diode is a two-terminal electronic component that conducts current primarily in one direction (asymmetric conductance); it has low (ideally zero) resistance in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the other. A diode vacuum tube or thermionic diode is a vacuum tube with two electrodes, a heated cathode and a plate, in which electrons can flow in only one direction, from cathode to plate. A semiconductor diode, the most commonly used type today, is a crystalline piece of semiconductor material with a p–n junction connected to two electrical terminals.[4] Semiconductor diodes were the first semiconductor electronic devices. The discovery of asymmetric electrical conduction across the contact between a crystalline mineral and a metal was made by German physicist Ferdinand Braun in 1874. Today, most diodes are made of silicon, but other semiconducting materials such as gallium arsenide and germanium are also used.","creator":"215972819492798464","createdon":"2020-06-07T19:00:24Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":106},"9962":{"name":"Cobweb","parents":[354,354,354,354,354,354,354,354,354],"image":"","color":"5432359","comment":"None","creator":"371155238805176321","createdon":"2020-09-05T01:30:22Z","commenter":"","colorer":"","imager":"","treesize":21}}
